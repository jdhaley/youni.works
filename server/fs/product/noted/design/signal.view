The path is known as the <i><b>circuit </b></i>and each arc (association) is a <i><b>connection</b>.</i></p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>A <u>Message</u>&nbsp;is a mutable object.&nbsp; When it is being used&nbsp; and carries, at a minimum, a&nbsp;<i><b>subject</b></i><br></p><p>The transmission channel identifies the associations between objects in the <i>network </i>graph transmission ? There are different types of signals that identifies the communication method "channel" that the signal propagation is traversing.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Apply:</li><li>Call:</li><li>Message:</li><li>Event:</li><li>Broadcast:&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The signal data is carried through a&nbsp;<i>message.&nbsp;</i>A message can be a string identifying the signal's&nbsp;<i>topic&nbsp;</i>or any mutable object with a&nbsp;<b>topic&nbsp;</b>property.&nbsp;</p><p>An&nbsp;<i>Owner&nbsp;</i>is a receiver that receives messages and propagates them within its ownership scope.&nbsp; Owners have a signal object whose methods perform the propagation.&nbsp; For example:</p><ul><li><u>owner.signal.Message</u></li></ul><p><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">is the method to propagate a Message signal.&nbsp; When a message is propagated, it is assigned a Symbol.Signal property identifying the signal/propagation.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">As signals propagate, the message is sent to receiver nodes within the channel graph.&nbsp; A receiver is any object with a receive(message) method.&nbsp; The receiver determines whether it will interact with the message through the topic and other state within a message object.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">A control is a receiver that delegates some or all signal processing to its&nbsp;</span><b style="font-family: sans-serif;">controller.process&nbsp;</b><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">method.</span></p></article>
